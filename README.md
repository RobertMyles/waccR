waccR
=====

`waccr` is an R package for the analysis of [Aswath Damodaran's](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/home.htm) weighted cost of capital (WACC) [data](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/wacc.htm). It simply downloads Professor Damodaran's data set into R and tidies it.

installation and usage:
-----------------------

``` r

remotes::install_github("RobertMyles/waccR")

library(waccR)

w_data <- wacc()
```

WACC
----

The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) represents the average cost of financing a company's debt and equity. There are two approches to calculating it, one based on the "Build-up" approach, the other on the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM) approach.

WACC = *C*<sub>*e*</sub> × *E* + *C*<sub>*d*</sub> × *D*

where *C*<sub>*d*</sub> is the after-tax cost of debt, E and D the proportion of equity and debt in a firm based on market value, and *C*<sub>*e*</sub> is the cost of equity, which, using the CAPM approach, is calculated with:

*C*<sub>*e*</sub> = *R*<sub>*f*</sub> + *β*(*R*<sub>*m*</sub>)+*R*<sub>*s*</sub> + Risk + Firm Risk

where *R*<sub>*f*</sub> is risk-free rate, *R*<sub>*m*</sub> is the market premium, *R*<sub>*s*</sub> is the company size premium, *Risk* the [country risk premium](https://github.com/RobertMyles/riscoBrasil), *Firm Risk* the firm-specific risk and *β* is a measure of the systematic risk, usually of the industry sector, in comparison to the market as a whole.

*β* for various sectors of US industry is available with:
